			<h3>What is equality and diversity?</h3>

			<p><em>Equality is ensuring individuals or groups of individuals are treated fairly and equally and no less favourably, specific to their needs, including areas of race, gender, disability, religion or belief, sexual orientation and age. </em></p>
            
            <p><em>The concept of diversity encompasses acceptance and respect. 
It means understanding that each individual is unique, 
and recognising our individual differences.  These can be along 
the dimensions of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, 
political beliefs, or other ideologies.  It is the exploration 
                of these differences in a safe, positive, and nurturing environment.</em></p>
